# Grafana Dashboards

This repository contains a curated collection of Grafana dashboards developed to enhance observability in Kubernetes clusters. The dashboards provide insights into certificate management, security vulnerabilities, and container log analysis, using tools like `cert-manager`, `Trivy`, and `Loki`.

## Dashboards Overview

### 1. **Certificate_Dashboard.json**
A focused dashboard displaying the health and status of TLS certificates managed by `cert-manager`.

- ‚úÖ Ready Certificates  
- ‚è≥ Pending Certificates  
- ‚ùå Failed Certificates  
- ‚åõ Certificates Expiring in <30 Days  
- üìä Expiration Breakdown by Certificate  

Useful for tracking cert lifespans and automation success in production clusters.

---

### 2. **CertManager_Extended_Dashboard.json**
An enhanced version of the certificate dashboard with extended insights and improved visuals.

- Adds granular expiration details  
- Displays cert states with Prometheus metrics  
- Useful for environments with multiple cert issuers or namespaces

---

### 3. **Trivy Operator Dashboard.json**
Visualizes security findings from the [Trivy Operator](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator).

- üîç Misconfigurations, exposed secrets, and RBAC issues  
- üìä Vulnerability count by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Unknown)  
- üìà Time series of vulnerabilities by namespace  

---

### 4. **Trivy Operator Reports.json**
Simplified summary dashboard that aggregates vulnerability metrics by severity.

- Bar and area charts for:  
  - LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL, UNKNOWN vulnerabilities  
  - Total count over time  
- Good for executive summaries or red/yellow/green risk reporting

---

### 5. **Trivy Vulnerabilities.json**
A specialized dashboard intended for use with the [Kube Trivy Exporter](https://github.com/kaidotdev/kube-trivy-exporter).

- Gauge visualizations per severity level  
- Lightweight and ideal for alert-based dashboards  
- Companion to Grafana dashboard ID `12330`

---

### 6. **Kubernetes_log_from_Loki.json**
A general-purpose log search dashboard backed by [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/).

- üîé Query by namespace/pod and free-text search  
- üìà Timeseries log frequency panel  
- üìÑ Log viewer with wrap, sort, and filter options  

---

### 7. **Loki_Kubernetes_Logs.json**
Another Loki-backed dashboard with more advanced templating and visual customizations.

- üìÑ Log stream by namespace, container, and stream type  
- üí° Includes dynamic search input and templated filtering  
- Great for troubleshooting specific microservices

## Getting Started

1. Install [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/download) and your preferred data sources (Prometheus, Loki).
2. Import dashboards from JSON via the Grafana UI or API.
3. Adjust data source UIDs in the JSON if necessary.

---

## Requirements

- Grafana 9.x+ or 10.x recommended  
- Prometheus for cert-manager and Trivy metrics  
- Loki for Kubernetes logs  
- Trivy Operator (for vulnerability and config metrics)
